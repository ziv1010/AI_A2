Key Factors Driving Churn Predictions (Logistic Regression Coefficient Importance)
- "Complain": 66.76% – Customers who have lodged a complaint are by far the strongest predictor of churn.
- "IsActiveMember": 13.85% – Being an inactive member greatly increases churn risk.
- "Gender": 9.11% – Gender shows a notable influence in the model.
- "NumOfProducts": 3.90% – Fewer products held correlates with higher churn.
- "HasCrCard": 2.95% – Not having a credit card slightly raises churn probability.
- Additional factors (Card Type, Geography, Satisfaction Score, Age, Tenure) have smaller contributions.

Actionable Recommendations to Reduce Churn for High‑Risk Customers
1. **Address Complaints Promptly** – Since complaints dominate the risk, implement a rapid response team, offer personalized resolutions, and follow‑up to ensure satisfaction.
2. **Re‑Engage Inactive Members** – Provide targeted incentives (e.g., fee waivers, bonus points) to reactivate dormant accounts.
3. **Cross‑Sell Additional Products** – Encourage customers with only one product to adopt more services (e.g., credit card, savings account) to increase stickiness.
4. **Tailor Communication by Gender** – Use gender‑aware messaging that resonates with each segment’s preferences.
5. **Reward High‑Value, Loyal Customers** – For those with high credit scores and long tenure, offer loyalty bonuses to reinforce retention.
6. **Monitor Satisfaction Scores** – Even though its impact is modest, improving satisfaction can further lower churn risk.

By focusing on complaint resolution and re‑engagement of inactive members, the bank can address the two most influential drivers and substantially reduce churn among the identified high‑risk customers.
