**Feature Importance (Logistic Regression Coefficients)**
- **EstimatedSalary**: +11.14 (strongest positive driver of churn)
- **HasCrCard**: -2.31 (having a credit card reduces churn)
- **Geography**: -1.52 (certain geographies reduce churn)
- **Balance**: -0.65 (higher balance reduces churn)
- **NumOfProducts**: -0.49 (more products reduce churn)

**Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Targeted Upsell**: Offer additional products or credit card options to customers with low product counts and no credit card. This can increase engagement and reduce churn.
2. **Personalized Loyalty Programs**: For high‑salary customers, provide exclusive benefits (e.g., higher reward points, premium services) to increase perceived value.
3. **Geography‑Specific Campaigns**: Since geography has a negative coefficient, tailor marketing efforts in regions with higher churn risk (e.g., Germany, France) to address local preferences.
4. **Balance‑Boosting Incentives**: Encourage higher account balances through deposit bonuses or interest rate promotions, as higher balances correlate with lower churn.
5. **Complaint Resolution**: All top‑risk customers have a complaint flag. Promptly addressing complaints and improving customer service can mitigate churn risk.

**Next Steps**
- Deploy targeted email campaigns for the above customers.
- Monitor churn probability after interventions.
- Re‑evaluate model performance quarterly.
