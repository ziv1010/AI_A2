Key Factors Influencing Churn Predictions (Logistic Regression Coefficients, absolute magnitude):
1. HasCrCard (positive coefficient 11.14) – customers with a credit card are more likely to churn.
2. Balance (negative coefficient -2.31) – higher balance reduces churn risk.
3. Surname (negative coefficient -1.52) – reflects encoded categorical effect.
4. Age (negative coefficient -0.65) – older customers less likely to churn.
5. Tenure (negative coefficient -0.49) – longer tenure reduces churn.
6. EstimatedSalary (negative coefficient -0.24) – higher salary slightly reduces churn.
7. CustomerId (positive coefficient 0.16) – identifier effect captured by model.
8. IsActiveMember (positive coefficient 0.09) – active members slightly more likely to churn.
9. CreditScore (positive coefficient 0.04) – higher credit score slightly increases churn.
10. Geography (negative coefficient -0.03) – regional effect.

These factors together drive the probability scores shown above.
