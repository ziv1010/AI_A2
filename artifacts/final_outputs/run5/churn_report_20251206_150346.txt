Key Factors Influencing Churn Predictions (based on model coefficients and domain knowledge):
- "HasComplained" is the strongest positive driver of churn, increasing probability dramatically.
- Short "Tenure" (especially 1‑2 years) is associated with higher churn risk.
- Lower "CreditScore" correlates with higher churn.
- Lower "Balance" and fewer "Products" slightly increase churn likelihood.
- Being an "ActiveMember" reduces churn risk.

These factors align with typical banking churn behavior where dissatisfied customers with short relationships and weaker financial profiles are more likely to leave.
